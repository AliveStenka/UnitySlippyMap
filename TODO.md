TODO
====

Here is a short list of what could be fixed or added to UnitySlippyMap:

Fix the voodooish way I implemented the camera elevation and tile positioning (see the comments in Map.cs)
Add support for well known tile providers (derive from TileLayer.cs)
Add new map objects (polygons, lines, ...)
Display a location marker with orientation for the user
Better zoom rounding (>80%, <20%?)
Constraint the map to a given 'size', bounce on limits
Movements inertia
Pop new tiles with transparency
